# TypeScript Quick Start / Boilerplate

This is a quick start for TypeScript projects with some things that I like.

## Things That I Like

- Compile with Babel instead of tsc
- Testing framework (jest)
- Commit hooks to make sure nothing's broken (husky + lint-staged)
- Type validation (tsc)
- Code style enforcement (eslint + prettier)
- Commit message style enforcement (commitizen)
- Dependencies validated for usage (depcheck)
- package.json sorted (sort-package-json)
